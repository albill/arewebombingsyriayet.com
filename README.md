========================

Apparently, the United States (and friends) have decided that no lessons were learned from the last decade or so of Middle Eastern wars. I fully expect that we'll be bombing Syria and the innocent civilians of Syria will be hurt in this game. 

This site is simply to draw attention to our tiresome efforts of warfare. As a United States citizen, I do not condone our getting involved in yet another conflict in the region, especially one where we are more likely to kill innocents than have any positive effect.
