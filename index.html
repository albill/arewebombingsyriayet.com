<p style="font-size:small">Apparently, the United States (and friends) have decided that no lessons were learned from the last decade or so of Middle Eastern wars. I fully expect that we'll be bombing Syria and the innocent civilians of Syria will be hurt in this game.</p>

<p style="font-size:small">This site is simply to draw attention to our tiresome efforts at warfare. As a United States citizen, I do not condone our getting involved in yet another conflict in the region, especially one where we are more likely to kill innocents than have any positive effect.</p>
